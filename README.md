An EDA project on retail sales data to identify trends in customer behavior, product performance, and sales growth.

---

##  Project Highlights

-  Internship Project for Data Zenix
-  Focused on data-driven retail insights
-  Performed complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

---

##  Key Steps Performed

-  Data Preparation:
  - Loaded CSV dataset using `pandas`
  - Checked data types and column names
  - Converted date to datetime format
  - Ensured data quality (cleaning & corrections)

-  Descriptive Statistics:
  - Calculated mean, median, mode, std. deviation
  - Used `df.describe()` for overview

-  Time Series Analysis:
  - Set `Date` as index
  - Used `.resample("M")` to analyze monthly sales
  - Observed seasonal sales trends

-  Customer Insights:
  - Analyzed gender distribution
  - Studied customer age patterns
  - Identified purchase behavior trends

-  Product Analysis:
  - Found best-selling product categories
  - Compared quantity and price metrics

- Data Visualization:
  - Bar plot: Sales by Product Category
  - Line plot: Monthly Sales Trend
  - Heatmap: Correlation between numeric fields

-  Recommendations:
  - Focus marketing on dominant age/gender segments
  - Promote best-selling products more
  - Offer discounts in low-performing months
